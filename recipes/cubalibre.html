        <ul>
            <li>A tall glass. Very important.</li>
            <li>Some ice cubes.</li>
            <li>One bottle of only the finest soda pop.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the glass and place it firmly onto a desk surface.</li>
            <li>Fill the glass to roughly half of its height with ice cubes.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the soda onto the frozen rocks to make surface
                there isn't any development of fizz which would only increase
                the waiting time for the finished drink.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your drink, fellow Chad.</li>
        </ol>
