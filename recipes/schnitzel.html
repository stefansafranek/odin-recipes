        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This dish is one of the national dishes of Austria and totally 
            not stolen from Milan, despite other sources claiming it as such.
            Originally, people used cuts of veal but nowadays you can find versions 
            made out of chicken, turkey and pork. Some non-breaded variations use beef. 
            This here however descibes the classic breaded version available everywhere.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cutlets of pork/chicken/turkey</li>
            <li>1 small pan of breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>100 ml milk</li>
            <li> 2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups of rice</li>
            <li>1/2 of a lemon</li>
            <li>Sunflowerseed Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the cutlets with Seran wrap and pound it thin and tender using a
                meat tenderizer. </li>
            <li>Put the pounded cutlets in the flour, coating everything.</li>
            <li>Cover the cutlets with eggwash (whole eggs mixed with milk).</li>
            <li>Cover the cutlets in the breadcrumbs making sure there is no more wet spots.</li>
            <li>Put the fully breaded cutlets into a pan with a bit of oil on high heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, put the rice into a pot and add 4 cups of water. Let it boil then 
                reduce heat and keep stirring occasionally until no more water is left.</li>
            <li>When the edges of the cutlets are beginning to brown flip it over. Watch out
                for splashing oil. If that happens, lower the heat a bit.</li>
            <li>When both sides are evenly browned puit it on a paper towel to soak up excess 
                oil.</li>
            <li>Plate the Schnitzel and the rice in an even fashion.</li>
            <li>Drizzle some of the lemon juice on top of the Schnitzel to be <em>fancy</em></li>
        </ol>
