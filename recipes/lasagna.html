            <li>Boil a large pot of water with added salt</li>
            <li>I a large pan heat 2 tbsp of olive oil on medium heat.
                Add the ground beef and cook until brown on all sides.

            </li>
            <li>Slice the bell pepper, dice the onion, mince the garlic.
                Add the pepper and onion in the pan and cook until the 
                onion is translucent and the pepper is softened.
                Add the garlic and cook for a minute longer.
                Put the beef back in and stir while reducing the heat
                for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Put the beef mixture in a large pot and add everything
                tomato to the pot.Add parsley, oregano, seasonings to 
                taste. Add some garlic to taste.

                a time to taste. Add salt to taste but keep in mind 
                parmesan is also salty so don't overdo it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the sauce to a simmer and lower the heat to
                maintain a light simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes and
                keep stirring. Make sure to scrape the bottom ever so 
                often so you don't burn anything.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from heat</li>
            <li>Put the lasagna sheets in the boiling water to cook
                them al dente. Make sure to stir ever so often so 
                nothing sticks.
            </li>
            <li>Drain the noodles in a collander and put them on a 
                baking sheet lightly covered in olive oil. Flip the 
                noodles around so that they get covered in oil and 
                don't stick to each other 
            </li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 375Â°F.</li>
            <li>Take a casserole and put the lasagna sheets at the 
                bottom. Put some sauce on it and grate some cheese on top
                Repeat this step until there is no more sauce and no 
                more noodles. 
            </li>
            <li>Grate the last remaining cheese on top and sprinkle any
                remaining herbs on it.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the casserole in aluminum foil, slightly tented.
                Put it in the oven for 45 minutes. If you like it crispy 
                you can remove the foil for the last 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Let it cool for 15 minutes unless you want to burn
                your tounge.
